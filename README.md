## Unsweetener
A web app built with React and Express using the USDA APIs to find out which sweeteners (both artifical and natural) have been added to food and drinks. Being hosted on Netlify, the server uses lambdas to make the outgoing API requests.

### Getting Started
This repo contains both the client and server files, as well as Netlify commands in the root.  
To start quickly, run `npm run install:all` in the root directory, and then run `npm start` as usual.
