Styling:
    ☐ fix header
    ☐ display ingredients better

☐ fix the "no search results" case
☐ maybe show examples of things to search in the search bar instead of "search..."
☐ show more information about the food item
☐ "powered by usda api" footer
☐ "back to search results" link
☐ clean up search page to show what was searched for

figure out what extension I have on desktop so I can put it on my laptop :)
- test searchin with hyphens
- fixed width search results
- links to google/usda/wikipedia/something
- fix problem since searching for "coca cola" doesn't bring back coca-cola as the first results... I guess make the search smarter, if possible
