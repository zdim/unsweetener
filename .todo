Styling:
    ✔ fix header @done (4/25/2019, 7:17:59 PM)
    ☐ display ingredients better

☐ fix the "no search results" case
✔ maybe show examples of things to search in the search bar instead of "search..." @done (4/25/2019, 7:17:53 PM)
☐ show more information about the food item
✔ "powered by usda api" footer @done (4/25/2019, 7:17:23 PM)
✔ "back to search results" link @done (4/25/2019, 7:17:25 PM)
✔ clean up search page to show what was searched for @done (4/25/2019, 7:17:28 PM)

☐ test searching with hyphens
☐ fixed width search results
☐ links to google/usda/wikipedia/something
☐ fix problem since searching for "coca cola" doesn't bring back coca-cola as the first results... I guess make the search smarter, if possible
☐ error handling when search breaks (maybe make the search bar red?)
☐ do something about all the duplicates


Notes:
    need to do something about the terrible search results
    e.g. search "pizza rolls" and see a monstrosity show as the first results
    > SAUSAGE & PEPPERONI SEASONED PORK, CHICKEN AND BEEF PIZZA TOPPING PIZZA IN A GOLDEN CRUST PIZZA SNACKS ROLLS, SAUSAGE & PEPPERONI
    :up: that's the name

    possibility, add some type of "report this" or "suggest change" button or link to the food page
    need to create a table in the db that tracks these reports
    from there, either make the updates by hand?
    store the updates in a separate overrides table
    that would potentially increase the requests per food item, since we'll need to grab both the original food item as well as the overrides
